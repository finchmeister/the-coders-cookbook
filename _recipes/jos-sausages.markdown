1. Preheat the oven to 200c and get a large 30cm x 30cm ovenproof dish.
2. Roast the sausages for 20-25 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, boil the carrots and leeks in a large saucepan for 5 minutes.
Then add the potatoes for a further 6 minutes or until tender. 
Drain into a vessel and set aside.
4. As the veg is boiling away, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a gentle heat,
then add the flour. Whisk until a smooth paste, then gradually add the stock.
By now the veg should have been drained, gradually add about 300ml of the veg
juice into the stock. Boost the heat and bubble the sauce until thickened. Then add
half the cheese and season with plenty of pepper.
5. Combine the cooked vegetables and sausages in the dish, pour over the sauce then
sprinkle the remaining cheese. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until bubbling and golden
then finish under grill for 5 minutes.
